Episode5-------------------------------------------------------------------


React Hooks-
(Normal js utility functions )

  two very important Hooks 
   --useState, --useEffect
  useState=this is used to create state variable 
  useEffect=


  Virtual DOM- this is the representation of Actual Dom.
            -  it is  a js object.

            How it gets updated-
             it compares the new and old virtual DOM ,and updates the child.

Episode 6 (most important)
        API call - fetch and axios
        Shimmer - UI - the UI build instead of loader
        useState importance - becauase there is no way that react can track of change in variable but when we use usestate , it rerenders as soos as the state of variable changes.
        Whenever local state variable updates, the whole component gets rerendered .
